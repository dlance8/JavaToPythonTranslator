The grammar for each node is commented under its corresponding functions in translator.java
For example:

    private void compilationUnit(NonterminalNode parent){
        // CompilationUnit = [ PackageDeclaration ] , { ImportDeclaration } , { TypeDeclaration } ;
    }

Nodes with "" surround them are Terminal nodes (e.g. a variable name or value). Translations usually happen here.
    // "for", "while", "Hello World"

Nodes with nothing surround them are Nonterminal nodes. (e.g. Variable declaration or class declaration)
    // MethodDeclarator

Nodes with [] indicate that it may appear once, or not at all
    // [ PackageDeclaration ]

Nodes with {} indicate that it is repeating ("can occur multiple times")
    // { ImportDeclaration }

Grammar including a | indicates "or"
    // BlockStatement = LocalVariableDeclarationStatement
    		//                | ClassDeclaration
    		//                | Statement ;
